"""Convenience utility for modifying the network view color palette."""

== Overview ==

The default color palette is tedious to modify. This tool allows you to rearrange colors, change them with ease, add new ones via gradient or hex-code as well.

== Main Color List ==

== Gradient-Based ==

    === Gradient Controls ===

    Sample Screen Colors:
        #id: btn_grad_screen

        You can also right click the word "Gradient to Sample" and select "Sample Screen Colors" from the bottom of that menu for any ramp parameter.

    === Cosine-Based Gradient Parameters ===

    Brightness:
        #id: grad_a
        Affects brightness of R, G, and B channels.
    Contrast:
        #id: grad_b
        Affects contrast of R, G, and B channels.
    Frequency:
        #id: grad_c
        Affects how quickly the R, G, and B channels transition through a cosine cycle.

== Text-Based ==

    Add Text Here:
        #id: text
        1 swatch per line or it will fail. Using color.adobe.com or other sites, you can sometimes extract palettes in a text format. This can turn those into swatches to use IF they are formatted correctly.
