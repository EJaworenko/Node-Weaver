"""A tool for making tools, automating tedious processes and improving TD quality of life."""

== Overview ==

A list of the functions this tool can do so far:
- Generating menu and action button script (in progress).
- Create the necessary nodes to convert a copy to points setup into an instanced setup.
It is a work in progress and will be updated as I add more features.

    === Asset ===

    Asset # Name:
        #id: inst_asset_name
        This string is used to name the nodes created by this tool. 

    Geometry to Instance:
        #id: inst_sop_target
        The SOP Geometry node that will be instanced. There needs to be an int or string attribute on it to differentiate between variants, even if there is only 1 variant.
        
    Points to Instance:
        #id: inst_sop_points
        The SOP Points node where instances will be copied to. It DOES NOT need a variant attribute, it will have the Geometry to Instance distributed to it in a random and uniform fashion.
        
    Variant Attribute:
        #id: inst_var_attrib
        The name of the variant attribute on the Geo to Instance. Only supports string and integer attributes.
