# Node Weaver Features

> [← Back to main documentation](../README.md)

I've created Node Weaver to streamline common Houdini TD tasks and make network customization easier. Here's what each tool does and how to get started with them.

## Available Tools

### Tool Maker Tools
[Documentation →](tool-maker-tools.md)

The Tool Maker Tools came from my own needs as a TD, automating repetitive tasks like:
- Generating menu and action button scripts
- Converting copy-to-points setups to instancing
- Mass-connecting parameters between nodes
- Finding and replacing node names

I've included several shelf tools and right-click menu additions to make these features easily accessible.

### Node Shape Creator
[Documentation →](node-shape.md)

After seeing the work by Simon Fiedler and Bastian Schiffer on custom node shapes, I wanted to make the process more accessible. This tool lets you:
- Design custom node shapes with real-time preview
- Export directly to Houdini's format
- Analyze existing node shapes
- Test shapes with different wire configurations

### Color Palette Configurator
[Documentation →](color-palette.md)

Getting tired of the default node colors, I built this to make network organization more flexible. You can:
- Modify the default color palette
- Create custom gradients
- Import colors from hex codes
- Save and share color schemes

## Getting Started

Each tool has its own documentation page with:
- Detailed usage instructions
- Examples and screenshots
- Tips and tricks
- Common issues and solutions

## Need Help?

If you run into any issues or have questions:
1. Check the individual tool documentation
2. Look at the [troubleshooting guide](../troubleshooting.md)
3. [Open an issue](https://github.com/EJaworenko/Node-Weaver/issues) if you're still stuck

I appreciate all feedback and bug reports - they help make these tools better!
